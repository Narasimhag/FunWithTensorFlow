# Fun with TensorFlow
Contains all the notebooks that I use to tinker with TensorFlow 2.0. Title is definitely not inspired from Sheldon's show on TBBT. ;D

Notebook | Short Description
--- | ---
TF_Basic_Image_Classifier.ipynb | A simple image classifier which takes the fashion_mnist dataset of TF and trains a model on it.
Sarcasm Detector.ipynb | We are suffering from too much sarcasm. - Marianne Moore. But are we though? This model trained on sarcasm headlines from HuffPost, detects if a sentence is sarcastic or not.
ResNet.ipynb | Deep Neural Nets are hard and time consuming to train. But what if we have a technique to skip connections? [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) addresses the same issue. I tried implementing it in this jupyter notebook.
